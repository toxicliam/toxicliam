Hey everyone, my name is Liam, also known as ruuffian. I have a Bachelors in Math and Computer Science from Temple University, and I work as a Junior Systems Administrator at Epsilon Technology Group. I also help run and manage the [Low Budget LCS](https://lowbudgetlcs.com), and lead their dev team.

If you want to talk about programming or anything at all, hit me up on Discord @ruuffian or at my email ruuffian@gmail.com.

You should use [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) :-)
